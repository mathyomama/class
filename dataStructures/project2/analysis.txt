The worst case time complexity of erase(iterator itr) is Big-O(n).
The worst case is when the iterator is the first element.
This means that every element after the first must be shifted to the position before it.
So the for loop in the erase procedure will have to execute "n - 1" times where "n" is the number of elements.
The constant can be disregarded and the time complexity can be reduced to big-O(n).
