The time complexity of height(BSTNode *t) is bigO(n) where n is the number of
nodes in the subtree and including t. Every node under "t" and including "t"
must be visited once by the function call, height. (The function "height" will
actually be called 2*n + 1 times since it has to reach nullptr for the base case,
which is how I implemented the function. This is still bigO(n).)
